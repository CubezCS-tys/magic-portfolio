## Overview

This research project focused on developing comprehensive mathematical frameworks for pricing barrier options, a critical component in derivatives trading and risk management.

## Key Features

### Interactive Dashboard
Built an interactive [Streamlit dashboard](https://barrier-options.streamlit.app) to visualise and compare numerical schemes:
- Real-time comparison of pricing methods
- Interactive parameter tuning
- Visualisation of convergence and stability analysis

### Mathematical Methods Implemented

#### Analytical Validation
Applied Itô's Lemma and stochastic processes within the Black–Scholes framework for analytical validation of barrier option pricing.

#### Monte Carlo Simulation
Integrated variance-reduction methods including:
- Antithetic and control variates
- Achieving **equivalent accuracy with 40% fewer Monte Carlo paths**

#### Finite Difference Methods
Implemented an adaptive binomial mesh achieving:
- **83% higher near-barrier accuracy**
- Dynamic grid refinement for discontinuous payoffs

### Performance Optimization

- Created fail-safe analytics dashboards for monitoring latency, throughput and query statistics
- Enabled data-driven system optimisation through real-time performance metrics
- Strengthened robustness via statistical error monitoring

### Analysis & Validation

- Benchmarked PDE and Monte Carlo solvers under various volatility regimes
- Analyzed convergence, runtime, and stability
- Demonstrated significant improvements in computational efficiency
