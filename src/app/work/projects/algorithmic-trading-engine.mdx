## Overview

Developed a sophisticated algorithmic trading engine from the ground up, combining quantitative strategies with robust risk management frameworks to support real-time trading operations.

## Key Features

### Quantitative Strategies

Implemented multiple trading strategies with rigorous mathematical foundations:

- **Mean-reversion pairs** with market-neutral positioning
- **Moving-average crossovers** for trend identification
- **ML-based forecasting** using advanced machine learning techniques

### Risk Management

Comprehensive risk modeling and control systems:

- **Options pricing modelling** with Black-Scholes framework
- **Trade speculation execution** with Islamic financial principles compliance
- **Bias mitigation** through statistical validation
- **Integrated risk management** for position sizing and drawdown control

### Performance Optimization

- Developed robust **backtesting framework** with bias mitigation
- **Sharpe ratio evaluation** and volatility clustering analysis
- **Trade frequency impact analysis** using multi-year equities data

### System Architecture

- **Event-driven design** for real-time processing
- **Live data feed integration** for market data
- **Statistical analysis tools** for strategy validation
- Focus on **Islamic finance principles** for ethical trading
